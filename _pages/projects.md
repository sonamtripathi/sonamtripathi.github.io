<img src = "https://Deepubhatt.github.io/images/Olympics_Analysis_Cover.png">

<span style="font-family: Cambria;"> In this project, I analyzed historical data from the modern Olympic Games to identify trends and patterns in athlete participation, country representation, and performance across various Olympic editions. The primary goal was to explore how athlete participation and country representation have evolved over the years, with a special focus on male-female participation trends. </span>

<span style="font-family: Cambria;"> **Tools Used:** </span>

- <span style="font-family: Cambria;"> **Excel:** For data loading, cleaning, formatting, and visualization </span>

<span style="font-family: Cambria;"> Using Excel, I conducted *univariate analysis* on key variables and developed an *interactive dashboard* showcasing historical trends in athlete and country participation. The dashboard also highlights the top countries and athletes with the most medals, the medal tally for leading nations, and the evolution of male and female participation over time. I incorporated *slicers for filtering* relevant insights, enabling users to focus on specific aspects of the data, and provided *Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)* for a quick overview. </span>

## <span style="font-family: Georgia;"> Global Terrorism Analysis: Uncovering Patterns and Trends (1970-2017) </span>

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](https://Deepubhatt.github.io/ipynb-html/Global_Terrorism_Analysis.html) [![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/Deepubhatt/Global-Terrorism-Analysis) [![Tableau Public](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tableau-View_Dashboard-blue?logo=tableau)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/deepak.bhatt1204/viz/GlobalTerrorismDashboard_16942921343660/GlobalTerrorismOverview)

<img src = "https://Deepubhatt.github.io/images/Global_Terrorism_Analysis_Cover.png">

<span style="font-family: Cambria;"> In this project, I comprehensively analyzed the historical Global Terrorism Database to uncover key insights about terrorist attacks worldwide. The primary objective was to identify geographical hotspots, analyze trends over the years, determine the most active terrorist groups, understand their preferred attack methods, and assess the scale of casualties, among other factors. </span>

<span style="font-family: Cambria;"> **Tools Used:** </span>

- <span style="font-family: Cambria;"> **Jupyter Notebook:** For Python programming and analysis </span>
- <span style="font-family: Cambria;"> **Python (Pandas):** For data cleaning and formatting </span>
- <span style="font-family: Cambria;"> **Tableau:** For creating dynamic visualizations and dashboards </span>

<span style="font-family: Cambria;"> Using these tools, I developed an interactive dashboard in Tableau that provides a clear visualization of global terrorism trends. The *dashboard highlights significant insights*, such as the most affected regions, the evolution of attacks over time, and the involvement of specific groups in different types of attacks. These visualizations provide a detailed overview, helping users quickly understand critical trends and patterns in global terrorism, which can inform *policy decisions*. </span>
