<span style="font-family: Cambria;"> This project focuses on analyzing the World Economic Indicator dataset to uncover the factors contributing to sustainable growth in various countries and regions. By examining a range of economic indicators, I aimed to provide actionable insights into how nations can achieve long-term economic stability. </span>

<span style="font-family: Cambria;"> **Tools Used:** </span>

- <span style="font-family: Cambria;"> **Excel:** For data loading, cleaning, formatting, and visualization </span>
- <span style="font-family: Cambria;"> **Google Sheets:** For generating reports </span>

<span style="font-family: Cambria;"> This Repository contains MNIST problem solved using 3 Method(Logistic Regression, Simple Neural network, Deep Learning Model)
Softmax Regression:
First we have use Simple Multinominal Logistic Regression or Softmax Regression. It is a generalization of Logistic regression for those cases where we want to handle multiple classes.In Logistic Regression we assumed that the labels are binary: . We used such a classifier to distinguish between two kinds of hand-written digits.Softmax Regression allows us to handle  where K is the number of Classes.
In Logistic Regression, we had a training set  of m labeled examples, where the input features are . With logistic Regression, we were in the binary classification setting, so the labels were .
In the softmax regression, we are interested in multi-class classification and so the label y can take K different values, rather than only two. Thus, in our training set , we now have that .In our MNIST digit recognition task, we would have K = 10 different classes.

Simple Neural Network:
Second we have also implemented Simple feed forward neural network for classificationwe have used softmax layer for classifying the digits to one of the 10 categories.

Deep Learning Model:
Lastly we have used Deep Neural model with "ReLU" activation function and "softmax" loss function.
Note: Copy the "notebook_importer.py" file which is used for importing the models from different ipython file.
