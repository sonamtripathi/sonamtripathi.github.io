## <span style = "font-family: Georgia;"> MNIST Digit Recognizer </span>

[MNIST Digit recognizer](https://github.com/sonamtripathi/MNIST_digit_recognizer)

<span style="font-family: Cambria;"> This project focuses on identifying the hand-written digits in real-time using the 3 Models(Logistic Regression, Simple Neural network, Deep Learning Model) 

**Softmax Regression:**
First we have use Simple Multinominal Logistic Regression or Softmax Regression. It is a generalization of Logistic regression for those cases where we want to handle multiple classes.In Logistic Regression we assumed that the labels are binary: . We used such a classifier to distinguish between two kinds of hand-written digits.Softmax Regression allows us to handle  where K is the number of Classes.In the softmax regression, we are interested in multi-class classification and so the label y can take K different values, rather than only two. Thus, in our training set , we now have that .In our MNIST digit recognition task, we would have K = 10 different classes.

**Simple Neural Network:**
Second we have also implemented Simple feed forward neural network for classificationwe have used softmax layer for classifying the digits to one of the 10 categories.

**Deep Learning Model:**
Lastly we have used Deep Neural model with "ReLU" activation function and "softmax" loss function.
