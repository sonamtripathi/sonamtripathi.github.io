## <span style="font-family: Georgia;"> 📚 📚 Technical Breakdown into the Model Context Protocol (MCP)</span>
<span style="font-family: Cambria;"> **Date Published:** *April 6, 2025* </span>

<span style="font-family: Cambria;">MCP is an open protocol that standardises how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardised way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardised way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools. In this section, we’ll dive into the technical aspects of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), including the key components involved in its design, how it is implemented, and how AI models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), interact with external data and tools using MCP.</span>

## <span style="font-family: Georgia;"> 📚 📚  LangChain for Beginners: Step-by-Step Code Guide to Building Advanced AI Workflows</span>
<span style="font-family: Cambria;"> **Date Published:** *March 30, 2025* </span>

<span style="font-family: Cambria;">LangChain is a powerful framework designed to streamline the integration and deployment of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4 for building complex, interactive, and intelligent applications.It provides a simple, extensible architecture for chaining together various components, allowing developers to focus on what matters most: creating intelligent applications that can process, query, and understand language data.In this article, we’ll explore the key components of LangChain, how they work together, and how to get started with a simple example.</span>

## <span style="font-family: Georgia;"> 📚 📚 Demystifying the CLIP Model </span>
<span style="font-family: Cambria;"> **Date Published:** *September 23, 2023* </span>

<span style="font-family: Cambria;"> Multimodal is a subset of deep learning models that deals with data from multiple modalities such as text, images, audio, visuals or any other types of data. The core idea behind these models are that they learn the features learned from different types of data and combine them to perform better at more complex machine learning tasks. Here I have covered the CIP model.</span>

## <span style="font-family: Georgia;"> 📚 📚 Complaints Classification using NMF </span>
<span style="font-family: Cambria;"> **Date Published:** *September 24, 2022* </span>

<span style="font-family: Cambria;"> In this article I will be using NMF(Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation) with the help of this technique, which is an approach under topic modelling, we will detect patterns and recurring words present in each ticket. This can be then used to understand the important features for each cluster of categories. By segregating the clusters, we will be able to identify the topics of the customer complaints.</span>
